A simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Java. Control the snake with arrow keys to eat food, grow longer, and avoid colliding with walls or the snake's body.
The game features random food generation, smooth snake movement, and real-time collision detection. Built using Java Swing for the graphical interface and AWT for handling key events and rendering.
